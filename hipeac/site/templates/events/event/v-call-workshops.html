          <catchphrase>The success of the workshops and tutorials of the previous years' HiPEAC Conferences with more than 35 events each encouraged the HiPEAC {{ event.year }} organizers to try following this success story again. Hence, in conjunction with the {{ event.year - 2005 }}th HiPEAC Conference in {{ event.city }}, {{ event.country.name }}, {{ event.datesStr }} we will organize parallel workshops and tutorials.</catchphrase>
          <p>Please submit your proposal not later than <strong>July 10, {{ event.year - 1 }}</strong>.</p>
