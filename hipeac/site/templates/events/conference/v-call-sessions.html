            <display-3>The success of the workshops and tutorials of the previous years' HiPEAC Conferences with more than 30 events each encouraged the HiPEAC {{ event.year }} organizers aiming at this success story again. Hence, in conjunction with the {{ event.year - 2005 }}th HiPEAC Conference in {{ event.city }}, {{ event.country.name }}, {{ event.datesStr }} we will again organize comprehensive parallel workshop and tutorial tracks.</display-3>

            <p>Proposals for workshops and tutorials covering at least one of the following topics are welcome:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>High performance computer architecture:</strong> processor architecture, multi-/many-core system design, reconfigurable architectures.</li>
              <li><strong>Software development for high performance parallel systems:</strong> development patterns/automatic techniques for parallel and reconfigurable architectures.</li>
              <li><strong>Tools for compilation, evaluation, optimization as well as synthesis of high performance parallel systems:</strong> compiler support, tracing, and debugging for parallel and reconfigurable architectures, high-level synthesis.</li>
              <li><strong>Embedded (parallel) computer architectures:</strong> embedded homogeneous and heterogeneous multicore architectures, embedded reconfigurable architectures, embedded real-time systems, mixed criticality system support, dependable systems.</li>
