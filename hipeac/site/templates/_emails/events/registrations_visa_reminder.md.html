**Registration number: {{ registration_id }}**

Dear {{ user_name }},

We've noticed in your registration form that *you need an invitation letter to apply for a visa*. To produce this letter, we would need the following information:

- Name and title
- Address and phone number
- Passport number
- Will you present a paper / poster? What is the title of the paper / poster?

As soon as you provide this information, we will send the invitation letter to you.

Please also let us know if the electronic copy is sufficient of if we should send the original signed letter to you by post.

Please contact <vicky@hipeac.net> if you have questions regarding your visa application.
