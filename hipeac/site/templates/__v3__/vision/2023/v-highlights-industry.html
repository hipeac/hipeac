    <p>The HiPEAC Vision takes a long-term (10-year+) view of computing systems. It outlines the main trends which are set to disrupt the computing industry and provides pointers for technology and integration development.</p>
    <p>What opportunities and challenges are offered by the ‘next web’? How will AI disrupt different industries? Are new paradigms such as quantum close to transforming the computing industry? What are the main regulatory issues to take into account?</p>

            <li>‘Everything as a service’ is becoming the dominant business model across a wide range of sectors, such as the next web, where applications will be coordinated together; here, trusted orchestrators will be key.</li>
            <li>Gaming is a huge revenue creator and driver of innovation.</li>
            <li>The trend towards specialized, rather than general-purpose, computing has resulted in a ‘programmability wall’ that eats into computing value margins. The scale threshold required to make highly specialized products integrate and work together keeps getting bigger, making it harder for smaller companies to compete.</li>
            <li>Open source allows European companies to pool resources and focus their energies on what differentiates them from the competition.</li>

            <li>AI is rapidly transforming the entertainment industry, for example with photorealistic real-time special effects.</li>

            <li>The spatial web requires standardization efforts to become a reality.</li>
            <li>Cybersecurity is becoming increasingly problematic, and computing systems will need to make security and privacy a first-class concern. Security is a potential differentiator for made-in-Europe ICT goods and services.</li>
