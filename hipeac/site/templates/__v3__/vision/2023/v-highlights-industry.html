    <p>The HiPEAC Vision takes a long-term (10-year+) view of computing systems. It outlines the main trends which are set to disrupt the computing industry and provides pointers for technology and integration development.</p>
    <p>What opportunities and challenges are offered by the ‘next computing paradigm’ (NCP)? What industry areas should Europe focus on? How will artificial intelligence (AI) disrupt different industries? What are the main regulatory issues to take into account? What do businesses producing digital products and services need to do to ensure that their offerings are secure and sustainable?</p>

            <li>Creating the NCP involves a series of challenges that offer new business opportunities. These include: embedding robust cybersecurity across an ever-more connected landscape; computing in real time; computing that takes the spatial reality into account; enabling the mobility of computing; and intelligent orchestrators to dynamically compose services. These trusted orchestrators could be an initial testbed.</li>
            <li>The key mechanism is ‘everything as a service’ (XaaS): applications will be composed of local and remote services that are dynamically aggregated to provide specific functionalities.</li>
            <li>The NCP will also generate new business opportunities on the applications side, thanks to improved capabilities such as faster image processing at the edge. Proof of concepts will help demonstrate the potential of its combination of multiple technologies.</li>
            <li>Developing AI foundational models should be a key priority for European industry.</li>
            <li>Embedding AI at the edge  is a prerequisite for the NCP and should be a focus area for Europe. It will also enable many new applications. Localized solutions and specialized accelerators will be key here.</li>
            <li>European companies should form part of a complete value chain in Europe , focusing on specialized architectures, system intellectual properties (IPs), electronic design automation (EDA) tools.</li>
            <li>The development of an ecosystem of interoperable chiplets, so that integrators can us a variety of chiplets, is potentially a key growth area for Europe. European companies should seek opportunities in this area.</li>
            <li>Open standards and platforms allow European companies to pool resources and focus their energies on what differentiates them from the competition, accelerating innovation.</li>
            <li>Trusted European companies would be the provider of choice for the NCP, to help ensure sovereignty and cybersecurity.</li>
            <li>Sustainability will need to become a key concern of information and communication technology companies. It is imperative that the industry develops new business models to prolong the life of computing devices, through repairability and maintenance, for example.</li>

            <li>The spatial web and more intuitive interfaces will transform the way people interact with the internet.</li>
            <li>The NCP’s decentralized model, dynamically composing services across computing resources, represents a paradigm shift from the cloud-dominated model of today.</li>

            <li>The spatial web requires standardization efforts to become a reality.</li>
            <li>European AI models should reflect stated European Union (EU) values.</li>
            <li>The NCP will need to incorporate real-time, safety-critical, security-critical  requirements.</li>
            <li>Code and hardware generated by AI must be auditable, modifiable and certifiable to ensure trustability. ‘Correctness by construction’ should be pursued as much as possible.</li>
            <li>The NCP throws up more issues for cybersecurity, given the increased attack surface and the dynamic composition of services, and for privacy, as the technologies are becoming increasingly interwoven into people’s lives. Computing systems will need to make security and privacy a first-class concern. Regulations such as the Cyber Resilience Act will need to be taken into account when developing digital products and services.</li>
            <li>Mandatory lifecycle assessments and / or sustainability labels would require a rethink of the current approach to building and using computing systems.</li>
