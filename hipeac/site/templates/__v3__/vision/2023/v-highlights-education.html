    <p>The HiPEAC Vision provides a long-term (10-year +) view of trends in computing systems. It provides educators with up-to-date material on computer science and engineering topics, along with key thinking points.</p>
    <p><strong>Computer science and engineering education</strong></p>
    <p>In the context of a volatile and uncertain globalized world, it can be challenging to know how best to prepare students, particularly in the fast-moving field of technology. While formal learning can teach reasoning and fundamental concepts, this should be complemented by learning about current solutions in a more informal setting. Moreover, as artificial intelligence becomes increasingly powerful, education should help students acquire a broad base of supporting knowledge and skills in areas that distinguish humans from robots, e.g. problem solving, critical thinking, coordination with others, decision-making, etc. These should supplemented by in-depth knowledge of one or more areas; this is known as a ‘comb-shaped profile’.</p>
    <p>With digitalization encompassing almost every part of our daily lives, it is essential that ethics becomes an integral part of computing education, and sustainable computing should form part of this. Europe has an opportunity to become a leader in the field of sustainable and ethical computing studies.</p>

        <div class="q-pa-md">
          <p>The next web will be increasingly immersive, spatial, and entwined with the physical world. It will integrate elements such as artificial intelligence, the tactile internet, and swarm intelligence, all coordinated along the compute continuum.</p>
          <p>To manage increasing complexity, integrate services smoothly and protect users, HiPEAC proposes ‘Digels’, short for ‘digital genius loci’. Find out more in this video [link].</p>
          <p>Discussion prompts:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>What is your vision for the ‘next web’?</li>
            <li>What are the main enabling technologies that will be required to make it a reality?</li>
            <li>What kind of safeguards or requirements should be taken into account in its deployment?</li>

        <div class="q-pa-md">
          <p>AI is delivering incredible results and can be used for everything from drafting essays to coding. However, large language models (LLMs), the basis of popular AI applications such as the GPT series, use enormous amounts of compute power and data to train. In addition, they can be prone to bias, making errors and do not really have an ‘understanding’ of the topics they talk about.</p>
          <p>Discussion prompts:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>How can we make more efficient AI models?</li>
            <li>What would be the most compelling applications of AI?</li>
            <li>How can we counter issues such as bias, misinformation and errors?</li>
            <li>Should AI deployment be paused or regulated?</li>

        <div class="q-pa-md">
          <p>With Moore’s Law slowing, researchers are turning to alternatives to the classic von-Neumann architecture. Examples of innovative technologies being explored include quantum computing, neuromorphic computing, spintronics, photonics, in-memory computing and flexible electronics. Future computing systems will be characterized by classical platforms complemented by specialized accelerators drawing on these disruptive concepts.</p>
          <p>Discussion prompts:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>What are the main alternatives to traditional von Neumann, CMOS-based computers?</li>
            <li>What level of maturity are these technologies at?</li>
            <li>What are the strengths and drawbacks of each?</li>

        <div class="q-pa-md">
          <p>Now that digital technologies control everything from aeroplanes to electricity distribution, the attack surface for cyberattackers has become much larger and the stakes are much higher. The potential fallout from a vulnerable component which is used widely is huge. Cybercrime has become professionalized, while cyberwarfare is increasingly a feature of modern conflict.</p>
          <p>Privacy is also a key concern in computing system design. Ever more data is being collected and analysed, often without users being aware. This can have serious ethical implications.</p>
          <p>Discussion prompts:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>What are the main elements involved in cybersecurity? (e.g. trusted computing base, cryptography, automatic detection and mitigation of vulnerabilities)</li>
            <li>How can we design more secure systems from the outset?</li>
            <li>What are the main techniques used to protect users’ privacy, and how could we improve upon these?</li>
            <li>What are the benefits and drawbacks of mandating stronger cybersecurity, with liability penalties, and stronger privacy safeguards, such as those in the GDPR?</li>

        <div class="q-pa-md">
          <p>Recent events have exposed weaknesses in the globalized economy, with supply chains being disrupted by issues such as the global pandemic, conflicts, resource shortages, and social unrest. Europe is currently not a superpower in computing: it has a strong research culture, but commercialization is weaker. While there are a few European companies which are crucial to semiconductor production, such as ASML for lithography, in general chip production takes place elsewhere. Similarly, crucial software infrastructure is also controlled outside of Europe.</p>
          <p>Discussion prompts:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>What are the main digital assets that Europe cannot do without?</li>
            <li>Should Europe try to develop its own technologies, so that it isn't dependent on other world regions? What are the pros and cons of this?</li>
            <li>Why is open source important in technology development?</li>

        <div class="q-pa-md">
          <p>The way computing systems are currently designed contributes to the unsustainable pressure humans put on natural ecosystems. Computing devices are produced using scarce raw materials, their production process is polluting, and they contribute to large amounts of e-waste at the end of their lifetime. The energy required to produce and power computing systems is also a concern. On the other hand, digitalization has the potential to help countries meet sustainability goals and adapt to climate change, for example through renewable energy distribution or precision agriculture.</p>
          <p>Discussion prompts:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>What are the main considerations for designing more sustainable computing systems?</li>
            <li>Can you think of solutions to current unsustainable practices in device production?</li>
            <li>How can we extend the lifetime of devices and reduce their energy use?</li>
            <li>What would be impactful use cases of computing put to the service of sustainability goals?</li>
