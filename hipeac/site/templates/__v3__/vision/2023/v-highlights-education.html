          <p>The HiPEAC Vision for the future of computing is the ‘next computing paradigm’, or NCP: a convergence of key technologies from the web, cyber-physical systems (CPS), the cloud, the internet of things (IoT), digital twins, and artificial intelligence (AI) into a coherent, federated ecosystem. This ecosystem emphasizes spatial computing, (generative) AI at the edge, dynamic web integration, user-centric models and intelligent, efficient and trustable orchestration of distributed services. The NCP would be used to power applications of major societal benefit, via non-proprietary, vertical integrations.</p>
          <p>Discussion prompts:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>What do you think of the ‘next computing paradigm’? Do you think it makes sense as a vision for the future of computing?</li>
            <li>How much do you know about each of the main enabling technologies that will be required to make it a reality?</li>
            <li>What challenges could you see arising from widespread deployment of the NCP? What kind of safeguards or requirements should be taken into account in its deployment?</li>
            <li>What is your vision for the future of computing? What would you like to see over the next 10 years?</li>

          <p>AI is riding a wave, and its influence can be seen everywhere.</p>
          <p>However, large language models (LLMs), the basis of popular AI applications such as the GPT series, use enormous amounts of compute power and data to train. In addition, they can be prone to bias, making errors and do not really have an ‘understanding’ of the topics they talk about.</p>
          <p>Discussion prompts:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>How can we make more efficient AI models? What factors do we need to take into account to run powerful AI on edge devices?</li>
            <li>What are the key technologies involved in building multimodal AI models?</li>
            <li>How could we use AI to generate new hardware and write new software code? Can you see any potential pitfalls in this? How do you think it will impact computer science and computer engineering education?</li>
            <li>How can we make AI models that consume less energy?</li>
            <li>Do you think open-source AI models are a good idea?</li>
            <li>Is it necessary to tailor AI models to the local context? For instance, should Europe produce its own AI models?</li>
            <li>How can we make sure the results generated by AI models are correct and unbiased?</li>
            <li>Should AI deployment be paused or regulated?</li>

        <div class="q-pa-md">
          <p>The boom in AI is increasing the need for efficient accelerators; conversely, AI can now also be used to help generate new hardware. In Europe, there is a need to create an ecosystem, which could focus on chiplets and interposers.</p>
          <p>Researchers continue to seek efficiency and performance gains through new technologies and innovative architectures. Examples include quantum computing, neuromorphic computing, new materials, information theory, spintronics, photonics, flexible electronics, 3D stacking, in-memory computing and adaptive precision.</p>
          <p>Discussion prompts:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>What are the main alternatives to traditional von Neumann, CMOS-based computers?</li>
            <li>What level of maturity are these technologies at?</li>
            <li>What are the strengths and drawbacks of each?</li>
            <li>What are the pros and cons of open standards and open-source hardware?</li>

      <q-expansion-item group="education" label="Cybersecurity and privacy">
        <div class="q-pa-md">
          <p>As computing systems are increasingly used to control more and more devices, and these devices are often interconnected, the consequences of cyberattacks are increasingly dramatic. The ‘next computing paradigm’ (NCP), which proposes even more connected components, services and devices, creates a larger attack surface, although it also allows greater decentralization, which can increase resilience. The cybersecurity of the hardware and software supply chains is also a major concern, especially with the massive reuse of software, open-source components.</p>
          <p>Privacy is also a key concern in computing system design. Ever more data is being collected and analysed, often without users being aware. This can have serious ethical implications.</p>
          <p>AI and large language models (LLMs) can help defend systems from cyberattacks, by detecting and analysing anomalies, but  can also  be used maliciously to carry out cyberattacks at scale.</p>
          <p>Discussion prompts:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>What are the main issues involved in cybersecurity? What principles should be followed to make systems more secure from the outset?</li>
            <li>How much do you know about some of the techniques used to make systems more secure? (e.g. trusted computing base, cryptography, automatic detection and mitigation of vulnerabilities)</li>
            <li>What are some of the ways in which artificial intelligence (AI) could be used to a) defend computing systems against attacks and b) carry out attacks?</li>
            <li>What are the main threats to users’ privacy? What techniques can be used to protect users’ privacy, and how could we improve upon these?</li>
            <li>What are the benefits and drawbacks of mandating stronger cybersecurity, with liability penalties, and stronger privacy safeguards, such as those in the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)? What impact do you think these would have on the open-source software ecosystem?</li>
            <li>What are the cyberthreats related to software and hardware supply chains? How can these be mitigated?</li>

        <div class="q-pa-md">
          <p>The way computing systems are currently designed contributes to the unsustainable pressure humans put on natural ecosystems. Computing devices are produced using scarce raw materials, their production process is polluting, and they contribute to large amounts of e-waste at the end of their lifetime. The energy required to produce and power computing systems is also a concern, while the CO2 emissions generated in manufacturing a new computing device currently, in many cases, outweigh the emissions generated in the operation of the device.</p>
          <p>Discussion prompts:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>What are the main considerations for designing more sustainable computing systems?</li>
            <li>Can you think of solutions to current unsustainable practices in device production?</li>
            <li>How can we extend the lifetime of devices and reduce their energy use?</li>
            <li>What would be impactful use cases of computing put to the service of sustainability goals? Do you think these could balance out or outweigh the footprint of producing and using computing devices?</li>
