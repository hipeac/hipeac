          <p>The ‘next computing paradigm’ (NCP) is  HiPEAC’s vision for the future of computing. The NCP merges aspects of the web, the cloud, computing systems that interact with the physical world, the internet of things, digital twins, the metaverse and artificial intelligence (AI) into a coherent continuum of computing, intertwining the real world with the cyberworld. The NCP brings space and time into computing, with users going ‘into’ it, rather than ‘on’ it. It will allow users to compose services on the fly, aided by a trusted personal assistant.</p>

          <p>The advance of AI is unstoppable, and it promises to transform multiple industries. While large language models (LLMs) such as those powering the ChatGPT application have grabbed headlines, powerful AI is also now increasingly in small devices like smartphones.</p>
          <p>Where should Europe focus its efforts in this area? Should we develop AI models that are tailored to Europe? What can we do to address errors, bias and other ethical issues in AI models?<p>

          <p>The incredible pace of technological development over the last 60 years has been enabled by constant performance improvements in hardware, but that is slowing now.</p>
          <p>To ensure continued performance and efficiency gains, what new hardware technologies are on the horizon? How will these be integrated into computing systems? What hardware technologies should Europe prioritize for development?</p>

          <p>What are the implications the NCP and greater connectivity in general for cybersecurity? How can AI be used both to implement better security and undertake cyberattacks? How can we protect users from cyberattacks and unwanted data sharing?</p>

        <div class="q-pa-md">
          <p>Information and communication technology (ICT) is estimated to contribute 2.1% to 3.9% of worldwide greenhouse-gas emissions – on par with the aviation industry – and this contribution is rising alarmingly. In addition to the CO2 emissions involved in the production and use of ICT devices, these devices also require a large number of rare minerals for their production, along with large amounts of water.</p>
          <p>Is energy efficiency equivalent to sustainability where computing systems are concerned? How many elements   and how much water are needed to make modern computing devices? What steps do we need to take to make computing systems and devices sustainable?</p>
