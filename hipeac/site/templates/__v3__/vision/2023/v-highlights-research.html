          <p><em>Vision:</em> a convergence of key technologies from the web, cyber-physical systems (CPS), the cloud, the internet of things (IoT), digital twins, and artificial intelligence (AI) into a coherent, federated ecosystem. This ecosystem emphasizes spatial computing, (generative) AI at the edge, dynamic web integration, user-centric models and intelligent, efficient and trustable orchestration of distributed services. The NCP will be implemented via non-proprietary, vertical integrations in a series of compelling use cases.</p>
          <p>Key drivers:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Data and interconnected machines: the NCP will have to integrate the ‘web of machines’ with the ‘web of humans’.</li>
            <li>Large-scale, safety-critical systems and digital twins: bringing new requirements to the web, including safety, real time and location.</li>
            <li>The spatial web: going ‘into’ the computing continuum.</li>
            <li>Everything as a service: applications for users will be composed by tailored coordination of services (including digital twins) to be run where it is most efficient.</li>
            <li>Smart orchestrators to orchestrate services according to the user’s requirements, and to protect and guide users in a trustable way. These will use AI for smooth, natural communication with humans.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Key areas of research to enable the NCP:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>4D-aware implementation technologies to support spatial and time-aware computing.
              <ul>
                <li>Merging HTTP-based REST-like protocols with spatial web protocols.</li>
                <li>Augmenting all such protocols so that they can guarantee timely delivery, for any granularity of time.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Augmenting application programming interfaces (APIs) with contract-based specifications that can allow compositions (and interoperability) based on assume / guarantee pairings with bi-authentication.
              <ul>
                <li>Improving WebAssembly-type technology to allow hosting and efficient execution of sandboxed in-transit computations.</li>
                <li>Allowing computations to move after travelling users or associated objects, seeking the optimal balance of latency, cybersecurity, privacy , data freshness, and energy requirements.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Connected, intelligent, cyber-physical systems that ensure physical safety, respect privacy, and defend against cyberattacks.</li>
            <li>Swarm computing supporting opportunistic dynamic and mobile aggregations of compute nodes within variable-sized logical regions.</li>
            <li>AI-powered, edge-based, trustworthy orchestrators that dynamically and opportunistically assemble APIs into ad hoc, private, service compositions.</li>
            <li>Using digital twins to model full systems and engineer optimizations holistically</li>
          </ul>
