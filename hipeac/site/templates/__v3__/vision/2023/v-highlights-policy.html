    <p>The HiPEAC Vision provides policy makers with guidance in defining priority areas for research on computing systems over the next 10 years. It analyses the main trends in computing systems development and outlines implications for Europe.</p>
    <p>Which areas should Europe prioritize for research? What infrastructure and support does Europe need to provide? Where should Europe consider introducing or strengthening regulation?</p>

          <p>The ‘next computing paradigm’ (NCP) proposed by the HiPEAC Vision 2024 should be the main focus for Europe. Europe should become a leader in key technologies necessary for the NCP, such as artificial intelligence (AI) at the edge.</p>
          <p>To achieve this, priorities for research investment include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Developing a standard representation and suite of protocols for encoding properties of physical objects and spaces, supporting mobile computation and devices, and facilitating 4D-enabled operations (i.e. operations that take into account space and time.</li>
            <li>Enhancing the application programming interfaces (APIs) of services with contract-based specifications for interoperability.</li>
            <li>Ensuring the trustability of the services presented, through verification, safety, privacy and security.</li>
            <li>Enabling the mobility of computation, dynamically relocating data and processes to where they are needed.</li>
            <li>Developing proof-of concept demonstrators of the NCP, showing the advantages of combining multiple technologies.</li>
            <li>Developing decentralized AI models for the edge and specialized accelerators to run such models at the edge.</li>
            <li>Ensuring that software and hardware generated by AI is auditable, modifiable and certifiable. Pursuing 'correctness by construction' as much as possible.</li>
            <li>Developing AI-powered, edge-based orchestrators to dynamically combine different services.</li>
            <li>Continuing the optimization of performance and energy efficiency in hardware through innovative technologies and architectures such as photonics, in-memory computing, 3D stacking, and adaptive precision.</li>
            <li>Identifying and addressing cybersecurity vulnerabilities in an increasingly connected computing paradigm, with a consequently greater attack surface.</li>
            <li>Developing techniques to increase the safety of AI models.</li>
            <li>Developing precise, comprehensive lifecycle models for information and communication technology (ICT) products and services, and creating sustainability-focused design methodologies based on these.</li>
            <li>Calling for cross-domain research projects to foster synergies between the application and technology domains.</li>

          <p>To make the NCP a reality, Europe needs to focus on providing the necessary support and infrastructure. Priorities include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Supporting open standards and platforms that allow developers to create cross-compatible tools and applications, as well as enhancing cybersecurity. This should include open access to AI resources. The European Union (EU) should become a leader in this area.</li>
            <li>Promoting interdisciplinary research, such as between new hardware paradigms (quantum, neuromorphic, new materials, information theory) and system architecture.</li>
            <li>Investing in infrastructure to support multimodal AI development.</li>
            <li>Developing and providing access to AI foundational models that are in line with stated EU values and ethics.</li>
            <li>Investing in tools and platforms that facilitate the use of AI for hardware and software development.</li>
            <li>Continuing to develop policy frameworks that promote access to AI, education about AI and ethical AI practices, building on the AI Act.</li>
            <li>Building an ecosystem to help innovative European solutions mature and gain traction, including hardware intellectual property and EDA tools.</li>
            <li>Developing a new ecosystem of interoperable chiplets, in which Europe can be a leader.</li>
            <li>Building new business models with sustainability at the core, which would embrace a difference approach including product maintenance long after the initial sale, for example.</li>
            <li>Establishing pan-European competence centres to centralize expertise and resources, facilitate knowledge exchange and streamline research efforts.</li>
            <li>Developing tooling to address cross-disciplinary and multi-dimensional challenges.</li>
            <li>Utilizing AI and digital twins to support cross-engineering activities and optimize system performance, safety and security.</li>

          <p>Areas where regulation should be considered include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Countering misinformation: deep fakes, real-time avatars, false AI-generated information.</li>
            <li>Curbing addiction and regulating addictive services, an issue which is likely to become more problematic due to the increasingly immersive nature of the NCP.</li>
            <li>Privacy, building on and enforcing GDPR.</li>
            <li>Reinforcing regulation on the liability of IT system providers (including AI providers) with regard to safety and security.</li>
            <li>Using the Digital Product Passport to include sustainability data and lifecycle models.</li>
            <li>Creating sustainability labels to help consumers make informed choices and to raise awareness.</li>
            <li>Mandate sustainability as part of business models and sustainability standards for new ICT products , including AI, for example to ensure repairability and maintenance.</li>
