    <p>The HiPEAC Vision provides policy makers with guidance in defining priority areas for research on computing systems over the next 10 years. It analyses the main trends in computing systems development and outlines implications for Europe.</p>
    <p>What are Europe's strengths and weaknesses? What areas should Europe prioritize for research? What infrastructure and support does Europe need to provide? Where should Europe consider introducing or strengthening regulation?</p>
    <p>Perhaps most fundamentally: in the era of ‘hyperhistory’, in Luciano Floridi's formulation, in which machines are producing the majority of data and have become the primary information agent, how can policy makers ensure that humans and human interests are at the centre of future computing systems?</p>

        <div class="q-pa-md">
          <p class="text-italic">Strengths</p>
          <p>Europe is strong in research and benefits from a very solid, affordable higher education system. There are significantly more PhD graduates per 1,000 of the population in Europe than in the US or China. Europe is also home to some of the key players in semiconductor technology development (such as ASML).</p>
          <p class="text-italic">Weaknesses</p>
          <p>However, Europe is weak in commercialization and lacks a venture capital culture. There is also a lack of advanced foundries in Europe, although the European Chips Act and investments by semiconductor companies may help the region capture more of the global chip market. In addition, there is a lack of qualified ICT workers.</p>
          <p class="text-italic">Opportunities</p>
          <p>The end of Moore’s Law offers an opportunity for Europe to regain technology leadership, for example through the design of specialist accelerators and associated ecosystems. Meanwhile, open source provides an alternative to (non-European) proprietary ICT solutions. As a driver of innovation, open source could also allow European industry to leapfrog over incumbent players, for example in the development of RISC-V-based systems.</p>
          <p>Europe is also facing societal challenges which can be transformed into opportunities. For example, as the world region with the highest number of people aged 60 or over, it could be the first to develop and commercialize solutions for the silver economy. As the global leader in publications and patents in the domain of climate action, the environment and renewable energy, it could be a leading provider of sustainability solutions. More generally, Europe could position itself as a provider of “quality” ICT; combined with regulation of access to the European single market, this could be a powerful way to boost European strengths, such as cybersecurity.</p>
          <p class="text-italic">Threats</p>
          <p>Europe has seen economic stagnation over recent years, while having to support an ageing population, dealing with a shrinking workforce and witnessing brain drain, particularly from Southern and Eastern Europe.</p>
          <p>The market for personalized computing devices is shrinking. Meanwhile, other world regions are investing significant resources into competing initiatives, such as the development of AI. Finally, geopolitical instability – the Russo-Ukrainian war, tensions between the US and China, and the global energy crisis, for example – is a constant factor, threatening supply chains and pushing up costs.</p>

        <div class="q-pa-md">
          <p>To coordinate and strengthen research, as well as attract talent, HiPEAC recommends establishing pan-European competence centres in computing and providing support projects for multidisciplinary areas such as cyber-physical systems. Access to compute resources powering large language models should be provided for European researchers.</p>
          <p>Europe should also invest in homemade ‘digital essentials’ and support open-source supply chains.</p>

            <li><strong>Curbing addiction</strong> and regulating <strong>addictive services</strong>, an issue which is likely to become more problematic as the web becomes more immersive.</li>
            <li><strong>Privacy</strong>, building on and enforcing GDPR.</li>
            <li><strong>Security</strong> certification for ICT goods and services sold in Europe, including liability for poor security.</li>
